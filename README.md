This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This code shows how to connect RainbowKit/Wagmi/viem libraries to a nextJS application and then to get a wallet balance for a given ERC20 token, and based on the event of clicking on a button initiate a transfer from one wallet to another. This code snippet was done in the context of writing an article for the Medium blog post [nextJS app: how to send USDT tokens between wallets?](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-connect-nextjs-application-to-a-test-blockchain-840d7fa4bb3e).
